**Warning: SelfBots are against the Discord Terms of Service. Use this bot at your own risk and be aware that you account can be terminated if you are not careful.**

Note: The SelfBot is untested on Discord.py v1.4 for the most part. Expect things to break to be honest if you use this old version of Discord.py, although there should not be much of an issue for the most part.

*Special Thanks to: TacticalSpoon331, Loac, and Static*.
